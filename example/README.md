# Password Engine Example App

This Flutter app demonstrates the `password_engine` API with multiple
generation strategies, custom character sets, and optional zxcvbn-based
strength scoring by calling the zxcvbn package directly.

## Highlights

- Random, memorable, pronounceable, and custom PIN strategies.
- Custom character sets using `CharacterSetProfile`.
- Toggleable zxcvbn strength estimator (direct package usage).
- Generate a strong password using `refreshPassword()`.

## Run

```bash
flutter run
```
